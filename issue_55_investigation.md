## Investigation

Current code:
- `get_cex_tokens()` returns `List[Token]` ✅
- `get_dex_tokens()` returns `DEXTokensResponse` ✅ (fixed in #37)

**Status:** Already fixed in PR #75 (issue #37). Both methods now return consistent typed objects.

## Proposed Solution

This issue is already resolved. We can close it as a duplicate of #37.
