## Investigation

Current code:
- Logging was added in #29
- `_redact_credentials()` method exists
- Credentials are redacted in logs

**Status:** Already fixed in PR #77 (issue #29). The `_redact_credentials()` method handles credential sanitization in logging.

## Proposed Solution

This issue is already resolved. We can close it as a duplicate of #29.
